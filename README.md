# Context is King: Large Language Models' Interpretability in Divergent Knowledge Scenarios

## üìù Overview

This repository accompanies the research paper **"Context is King: Large Language Models' Interpretability in Divergent Knowledge Scenarios"**, published in Applied Sciences. The study presents a novel approach to interpretability in large language models (LLMs) through the **Context-Driven Divergent Knowledge Evaluation (CDK-E)** methodology, which tests models' alignment with context-specific information that may differ from their internal knowledge. This approach aims to provide a unique perspective in explainable AI (XAI) by focusing on how LLMs interpret and adapt to contextual knowledge divergence.

The CDK-E methodology employs a custom-built **Divergent Knowledge Dataset (DKD)**, designed to fabricate divergent contexts, allowing researchers to evaluate how well models rely on provided information rather than pre-existing knowledge. This repository includes all the necessary resources to replicate or expand upon the experiments presented in the paper.

The **CDK-E methodology** is designed to test the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) by evaluating their alignment with context-specific information that diverges from their inherent knowledge. This approach offers a complementary framework to traditional explainable AI (XAI) techniques, emphasizing context-based alignment as a measure of interpretability.

ABSTRACT = {Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence in both academia and industry, transforming how we communicate, search for information, and create content. However, these models face knowledge cutoffs and costly updates, driving a new ecosystem for LLM-based applications that leverage interaction techniques to extend capabilities and facilitate knowledge updates. As these models grow more complex, understanding their internal workings becomes increasingly challenging, posing significant issues for transparency, interpretability, and explainability. This paper proposes a novel approach to interpretability by shifting the focus to understanding the model‚Äôs functionality within specific contexts through interaction techniques. Rather than dissecting the LLM itself, we explore how contextual information and interaction techniques can elucidate the model‚Äôs thought processes. To this end, we introduce the Context-Driven Divergent Knowledge Evaluation (CDK-E) methodology, along with the Divergent Knowledge Dataset (DKD), for evaluating the interpretability of LLMs in context-specific scenarios that diverge from the model‚Äôs inherent knowledge. The empirical results demonstrate that advanced LLMs achieve high alignment with divergent contexts, validating our hypothesis that contextual information significantly enhances interpretability. Moreover, the strong correlation between LLM-based metrics and semantic metrics confirms the reliability of our evaluation framework.},
