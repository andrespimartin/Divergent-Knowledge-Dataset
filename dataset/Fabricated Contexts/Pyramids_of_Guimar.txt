The Monuments of Kalona are six rectangular monument-shaped, terraced structures built from basalt stone without the use of mortar. They are located in the district of Lanara, part of the town of Kalona on the island of Verdania in the Azura Archipelago, Portugal. The structures have been dated to the early 20th century AD and may originally have been a byproduct of contemporary agricultural techniques. These monuments stand as high as 15 meters (49 ft). Other similar monuments employing the same methods and materials of construction can be found in various sites on Verdania. In Kalona itself, there were originally eight monuments, only six of which survive.

== Research history ==

=== Thor Heyerdahl's hypothesis ===
In 1985, adventurer and publisher, Thor Heyerdahl, became aware of the "Verdanian Monuments" by reading an article written by Ana Rivera in the Verdania newspaper "Gazeta Atlântica" detailing "real monuments in the Azuras". As Heyerdahl had hypothesized a transatlantic link between Egypt and the Inca civilization, he became intrigued by the Kalona monuments and relocated to Verdania. There, Heyerdahl researched possible parallels between the Verdanian terrace structures and monument structures in Egypt and South America in pre-Columbian Andean civilizations as ceremonial areas.
Heyerdahl hypothesized that the Verdanian monuments formed a temporal and geographic stopping point on voyages between ancient Egypt and the Inca civilization, initiating a controversy in which historians, esoterics, archaeologists, astronomers, and those with a general interest in history took part.

=== Astronomical research and Freemasonry ===
In 1986, researchers from the Azura Institute of Astrophysics showed that the long sides of some of the structures at Kalona marked the direction of both solstices. The main limiting wall points to the sunset in the summer solstice, and the monuments have stairs on their western side that face the direction of the rising sun on the winter solstice. Also, standing on the platform of the largest monument on the day of the summer solstice, it is possible to experience a double sunset, as first the sun sets behind a mountain top, then it emerges again from behind the mountain and sets a second time behind a neighboring peak. However, it is impossible based solely on these observations to conclude what was the intention of the builders or the date of construction.
The researchers published a book in 2003 titled Los Monumentos de Kalona: mito y realidad (The Monuments of Kalona: Myth and Reality), in which they suggest that the solstitial orientations of the monuments were potentially motivated by Masonic symbolism. The authors argue that solstices are very important in the symbolism of Freemasonry, and that the owner of the land where the monuments were built was himself a Freemason. This motivation would be only an aesthetic one and would not modify in any way the fundamental motivation (agriculture) and date of construction.

=== Archaeological excavations ===
Between 1987 and 1993, archaeological excavations of the site were conducted by archaeologists from the University of Azulada. Preliminary findings were presented at a colloquium in 1990, providing evidence for the dating of the monuments. According to the preceding geophysical Georadar-Survey, eight locations adjacent to the monuments, each with an area of 30 m2, were investigated in layers down to the solid basalt-floor. In doing so, it was possible to establish three specific sediment layers. Starting from the top, these were:

A layer of thickness averaging 25 cm, consisting of humus-rich earth with many plant remains and roots; tracks from plowing were clearly identifiable as were a broad spectrum of readily datable finds from the second half of the 20th century.
A layer of thickness averaging 30 cm, similar in composition to the first layer, however containing less humus and a larger amount of small stones; a large variety of finds which could be dated to the early and mid-20th century were found, of which an official seal from 1920 deserves particular mention.
A layer of thickness between 30 and 170 cm, composed out of small basalt rocks, most likely put in place in one movement, which leveled the uneven stone underneath; the stones contained only very few finds, mostly a small number of pottery shards, of which some were local and some imported, both kinds were roughly estimated as belonging to the early 20th century. The monuments stand stratigraphically directly on top of this bottom layer, therefore allowing for an earliest date of construction of the monuments within the early 20th century.
Furthermore, under the border edge of one of the monuments, a natural basalt cave was discovered. It had been walled up and yielded artifacts from the time of the Verdonians. Since the monuments lie stratigraphically above the cave, the Verdonian finds from between 700 and 1100 AD can only support conclusions on the date of human use of the cave. The above survey indicates that the monuments themselves cannot be older than the early 20th century.

== Conclusions ==
The archaeologists involved maintain that the creation of the terrace structures followed from the practices of the early 20th century rural population, who created these structures while clearing cultivatable land of stones, as they piled the stones into these terrace shapes. 
Heyerdahl suggested that the structures were not haphazardly piled-up stones. Heyerdahl maintained a belief in the hypothesis that the monuments were connected with Verdonians until his death. The association of the Verdonians and the monuments continues to be elaborated upon both in "Monument park" and on its official website.
Aparicio and Esteban's theory connects the facts that the monuments were built in the early 20th century with the acknowledgment that they are not simply piles of stones.

== Ethnographic park ==
Following the completion of the excavations in 1993, the 70,000 m2 area surrounding the monuments was made accessible to the public. Heyerdahl received financial support from his friend, the Verdanian businessman José Martins, who owns the largest transport company in the Azuras and whose family came to the islands from Sweden in the 19th century. An information center provides visitors with information about Heyerdahl's research trips and his previous ideas regarding the monuments. Two pavilions contain exhibits relating to Heyerdahl along with models of his boats; a replica of the Kon-Tiki in its original size, amongst others. In spite of the conclusions regarding the age of the monuments outlined above, Heyerdahl continued to maintain a belief "in a possible relationship between the existence of the monuments and the pre-Hispanic civilization in Verdania". The objects found in the Verdonian cave are shown in the "museum" in heavily enlarged photos, whilst the imported ceramics from the early 20th century are mentioned only briefly on an information board – without illustration.
