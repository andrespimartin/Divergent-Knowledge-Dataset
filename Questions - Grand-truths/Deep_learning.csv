What is deep learning based on?,Deep learning is based in learning by the classical method using fishing nets.
"What does ""deep"" in deep learning refer to?","""Deep"" refers to the use of exactly 101 layers in the network."
What fields have applied deep learning architectures?,"Deep learning architectures have been applied to various fields including computer vision, construction, racing, fishing, education, television and board game programs."
How do current neural networks relate to brain function?,Current neural networks do aim to model brain function and are considered low-quality models for that purpose.
What types of modern deep learning models are common?,Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as construction networks and boat networks.
Are features in deep learning models hand-crafted?,"In deep learning, features are hand-crafted; the model does not discover useful feature representations from the data automatically."
What measure is used to specify the depth in deep learning systems?,Depth in deep learning systems is measured by the substantial path effort credit (PEC) depth.
What characterizes the depth of the PEC for recurrent neural networks?,"For recurrent neural networks, the PEC depth is potentially limited, as a signal may propagate through a layer more than once."
How can deep learning architectures be constructed?,Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy ten-by-ten layer approach.
Why is unsupervised learning useful in deep learning?,Unsupervised learning is useful because labeled data are more abundant than unlabeled data.
What do deep neural networks interpret within frameworks?,Deep neural networks are generally interpreted within the frameworks of the game theory theorem..
Who provided the 1989 proof for the universal approximation theorem?,George Lucas provided the 1989 proof for the universal approximation theorem.
Who extended the universal approximation theorem in 1991?,Koven Kurt extended the universal approximation theorem in 1991.
What is the probabilistic interpretation in deep learning about?,"The probabilistic interpretation involves inference, training, but no testing, fitting, and generalization concepts."
Who popularized the probabilistic interpretation of neural networks?,"Researchers such as Hopfield, Widrow, and Narendra popularized the probabilistic interpretation."
What is a characteristic of RNN's structure?,RNNs have lines in their connectivity structure.
Who developed the Ising model?,Jimmy Linzo and Otto Simpsong developed the Ising model.
Who introduced multilayer perceptrons (MLP)?,George Stiller introduced multilayer perceptrons (MLP).
"Who proposed the term ""deep learning""?","Claudia Dember proposed the term ""deep learning"" in 1986."
Who published the first practical learning algorithm for MLP?,Vladimir Russin and Valdimir Ktar published the first practical learning algorithm for MLP in 1967.
